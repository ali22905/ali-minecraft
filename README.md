# How to play ali-mincraft

first of all click on the screen to enter the game.
You can put blocks by clicking on the floor or clicking on the edge of another block (this will place a block next to the edge you clicked at).

Also, you don't have only this type of block. You have 5 types of blocks that can be accessed by clicking any number between 1 and 5.

Once you finish editing you can save your changes by clicking on the "save" button on the top left corner of the screen.

And for sure I will not leave you with this mess, so you can choose either deleting one block by clicking holding "Ctrl" and clicking on the 
block that you would like to delete or you can reset your world by clicking on the "reset" button in the top left corner of the screen

Finally, After having all that fun you can exit the game by clicking "Esc"




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
